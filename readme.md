- Another user can join the room by entering the room id
- The game will start when there are two players in the room
- Both players will be assigned a color and will be asked for their name
- The game will be played on a 7x6 board
- The players will take turns to drop their colored discs into the board
- The first player to get four of their discs in a row wins the game
- The game will be played in real time
- At the end a winner will be declared and the game will be reset
